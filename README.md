# Robot-Arm
Robot arm with Arduino Nano.

## Idea
Idea for this robot arm was to make quick and cheap device for learning some algorithms needed for robot arm movements.
Interesting thing was to implement calculation to convert linear movement commands to servo angles.

Another (not yet implemented) idea was to add potentiometers to control movement in linear x, y and z directions.

## Parts
Many parts are done from cardboard, as it is easily available and easy to cut. Good for prototyping.

**Electronics**
- Arduino Nano (just any microcontroller)
- 3 servos (e.g. EMAX ES08MA II miniservos)
- 5 V voltage regulator (e.g. L7805CV)
- 100 uF capacitor

**Other parts**
- base
- first arm
- second arm
- mounting part between rotating servo and shoulder servo
